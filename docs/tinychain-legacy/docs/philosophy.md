lol let's write down why this code is so based:

1. minimum lines of code possible. this is the ultimate test of intelligence. intelligence is compression and prediction in one. can you produce a world model which is the smallest most accurate thing? this is what good code looks like - the smallest most functional thing.

2. > "Show me your [code] and conceal your [data structures], and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your [data structures], and I won't usually need your [code]; it'll be obvious."

3. functions should only do 1 big thing. you can do "integrate all the other things" or you can do "this one particular thing"

4. cut through the verbiage and just name things after what they really after

    RPC - just a way of invoking methods on objects across the network
    wire protocol - how we encode the RPC (HTTP+JSON)
    protocol - the abstract machine which we run the protocol on
