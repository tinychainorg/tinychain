Design

## Methodology.

 1. Make it work.
 2. Simplify / delete.
 3. Optimize. Make it efficient/fast.

## Philosophy.

1. Minimum lines of code possible. This is the ultimate test of intelligence. Intelligence is compression and prediction in one. Can you produce a world model which is the smallest most accurate thing? This is what good code looks like - the smallest most functional thing.

This has many advantages. Fewest lines of code for same functionality. Purer more functional code. More auditable. More extensible more easily without additional abstraction loading.

2. Discover the core primitives through distillation.

3. > "Show me your [code] and conceal your [data structures], and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your [data structures], and I won't usually need your [code]; it'll be obvious."
