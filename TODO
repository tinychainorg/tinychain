Currently:
- rename Sign(msg) to accept a sighash, and then add a sighash method to tx.go
- why is block body not being matched with block header?
    2024/07/23 20:59:08 [blockdag] Blocks with merkle root: 0
    sync_test.go:361: Error ingesting body: Block header not found for txs merkle root.
    sync_test.go:361: Error ingesting body: Block header not found for txs merkle root.
    sync_test.go:361: Error ingesting body: Block header not found for txs merkle root.


mempool
    listen for new txs
    put them in mempool
    inside node/miner?
        get a bundle from mempool
        mine on it

adjust miner
    restart mechanism to mine on new tip
    how does it do it now? 
    documentation on the functionality


state machine
    remove sanity check for blockreward/iscoinbase
    add proper tests





Sync / search

    Test sync - tip starts from genesis
    Test sync - tip starts from another branch

    test sync - 
        no peers
    
    test sync -
        one peer
    
    test sync -
        two or more peers
    
    branches of the chain
    - genesis
    - two competing branches, both same amount of work
    - three competing branches, downloads all headers from peers
    - two competing branches with different depths (ie. not branches, but fuller paths)

    test sync -
        get latest tip from peer
            returns latest tip
        get_tip_at_depth / getpath
            test max_depth=2048 and peer has mined 2048 blocks 
            test max_depth=2048 and peer has mined 30 blocks, returns block 30
    
    GetPath

Peer RPC's

    test peer returns blocks from syncgetdata
    test peer returns block bodies from syncgetdata
