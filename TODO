DAG

    [x] test IngestHeader
    [x] test IngestBody
    test updates full tip / headers tip

Parallel download

    [x] implement a really basic version which downloads in parallel. basically a dumb bittorrent
    [x] make sure it can work with peers joining/leaving
    [x] probably try to do it without channels just to start with (simpler mental model)


Currently:
- rename Sign(msg) to accept a sighash, and then add a sighash method to tx.go
- why is block body not being matched with block header?

Sync / search

    Test sync - tip starts from genesis
    Test sync - tip starts from another branch

    test sync - 
        no peers
    
    test sync -
        one peer
    
    test sync -
        two or more peers
    
    branches of the chain
    - genesis
    - two competing branches, both same amount of work
    - three competing branches, downloads all headers from peers
    - two competing branches with different depths (ie. not branches, but fuller paths)

    test sync -
        get latest tip from peer
            returns latest tip
        get_tip_at_depth / getpath
            test max_depth=2048 and peer has mined 2048 blocks 
            test max_depth=2048 and peer has mined 30 blocks, returns block 30
    
    GetPath

Peer RPC's

    test peer returns blocks from syncgetdata
    test peer returns block bodies from syncgetdata
